# Chennai-house-price-prediction

INTRODUCTION:
Welcome to the Chennai House Price Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting house prices in Chennai using machine learning techniques, specifically the linear regression model. With a remarkable maximum prediction score of 90.4%, this project aims to assist individuals in estimating the prices of houses in the Chennai real estate market.

If you're interested in exploring how machine learning can be applied to real-world scenarios, particularly in the context of real estate, this project offers valuable insights into the predictive power of linear regression models.

TECH STACK:
The Chennai House Price Prediction project is built using the following technologies and tools:

1. Python: The core programming language used for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

2. Machine Learning Libraries: Various libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy are utilized for data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.

3. Linear Regression: The primary machine learning algorithm employed in this project for predicting house prices based on input features.

4. Jupyter Notebook: Interactive and exploratory coding was done in Jupyter notebooks, allowing for clear documentation of each step in the data analysis and model development process.

5. GitHub: The repository is hosted on GitHub, providing version control and collaboration capabilities.

FEATURES: 

1. The Chennai House Price Prediction project offers the following features:

2. Data Preprocessing: Raw data collected from the Chennai real estate market undergoes thorough preprocessing. This includes handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling to ensure optimal model performance.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is conducted to gain insights into the distribution of house prices, the relationships between features, and potential outliers that could affect the model's accuracy.

4. Feature Selection: The most relevant features impacting house prices are selected through careful analysis and correlation studies.

5. Linear Regression Model: A linear regression model is trained using the preprocessed data. This model is capable of predicting house prices based on the chosen features.

6. Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics. The achieved maximum prediction score of 90.4% demonstrates the model's effectiveness in capturing patterns within the dataset.

7. Documentation: The codebase is well-documented, providing clear explanations for each step and decision made during data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
